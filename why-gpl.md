# Why GPL ?

## 1. Upstream

LLaMa using GPL, I have to follow its license.

## 2. A Story

In 2022, we plan to make [megflow](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegFlow/) public, I have spent 2 or 3 weeks to fullfill [FFmpeg License Compliance Checklist](https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html).

At that time I thought the GPL was like a contagious cancer, until ..

* A few months ago, I released [deploee](https://platform.openmmlab.com/deploee/), but after only 4 days, I suffered a database attack. Well, this is just a **free public service**.
* Days ago, an employee of [a large company](https://github.com/tencent/) deleted the commit history of a open source repo, and then sold it in his own community. After being exposed, he pretended to be a victim and yelled "you invaded my privacy and affected my work like this".

..

They shows no respect for the author of the code. 

So I decided to support GPL forever.
